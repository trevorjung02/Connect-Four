We learned how to create a web application, and in particular how to use sockets, which was a scary technology at first. 
One of the most enjoyable aspects of the project was creating the AI, which was fun to think about in terms of figuring out the right algorithms to use. 
In addition, it was fun to create the graphics of the program, and see the project as a polished game.  
The most challenging part of the project was getting the communication right, and figuring out how to code together.
We found that there were a lot of useful tutorials online that helped with understanding web development, in particular some of the Traversy Media crash courses.
